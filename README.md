This section is still WIP! So there's not much to see here, but some small instructions:

Setup:
- [Get it](https://github.com/Readek/RoA-Stream-Control/releases).
- Extract somewhere.
- Add browser source in OBS.
- Set 1920 width 1080 height.
- Local file -> 'RoA Scoreboard.html'.
- Use custom frame rate -> 60 (not sure if this is necessary)
- Tick 'Refresh browser when scene becomes active'.
- Manage it all with the 'RoA Stream Control' executable
