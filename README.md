# RoA Stream Control Electron Edition

This is an Electron rework of the graphical interface of the project. There's tons of work to do but for now you can get the idea of how it looks from the image above.

---

## TODO before an actual release
- Optimize the executable so it doesn't weight 100MB like what the fuck
- Beautify character and skin lists
- Player score managing via '+' and '-' buttons
- Beautify W/L buttons
- Same with 'Best of' buttons
- Player presets/autocomplete
- Choose like a cool font for the text or something
