![preview](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/574303886869790730/700308095779340298/unknown.png)

This section is still WIP! So there's not much to see here, but some small instructions:

Setup:
- [Get it](https://github.com/Readek/RoA-Stream-Control/releases).
- Extract somewhere.
- Add browser source in OBS.
- Local file -> 'RoA Scoreboard.html'.
- Set 1920 width 1080 height. (if it looks weird after this, set your canvas resolution to 1080p or make the source fit the screen).
- Use custom frame rate -> 60 (if streaming at 60fps of course).
- Tick 'Refresh browser when scene becomes active'.
- Manage it all with the 'RoA Stream Control' executable.

Same for the VS screen!
